# ERC-725: Identity and Claims Standard

ERC-725 is a proposed Ethereum standard for identity and claims on the blockchain. It defines a set of rules and interfaces that enable the creation and management of identity-based smart contracts.

## Key Components of ERC-725:
### Identity Smart Contract:
Represents an identity on the blockchain.
Holds key-value pairs of claims associated with the identity.

## Key Management:
Allows for the addition and removal of keys.
Supports different key types (e.g., Ethereum key, encryption key).

### Claim Verification:
Enables claims made by the identity to be verified by third parties.
Claims can represent attributes, attestations, or credentials associated with the identity.

### Execution of Claims:
Provides a mechanism to execute specific claims, enabling actions on behalf of the identity.

# ERC-735: Claim Holder Protocol
ERC-735 complements ERC-725 by defining a protocol for managing claims. It focuses on standardized claim formats, allowing claim issuers and verifiers to have a common understanding of the data.

## Key Components of ERC-735:
### Claim Holder:
An entity (smart contract or address) that holds claims about an identity.

### Claim Types:
Standardized claim types to represent different kinds of information (e.g., identity, keys, relationships).

### Claim Issuers:
Entities responsible for issuing claims.

### Claim Verification:
Mechanism for verifiers to check the authenticity and validity of claims.
